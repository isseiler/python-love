S3 new hire training CloudFormation templates I want to make.

#Tag all buckets with the name of 'NHT-S3-isseiler'

stacks to build

- S3 bucket owner full control required on Puts
	#create bucket, use prefix name of 's3-nht-require-object-ownership'
	#create bucket policy requiring bucket-owner-full-control on PutObject actions

EASY
- create publicly readable bucket, given it a public ACL and public bucket policy


MEDIUM
- request payer scenario
	- publicly writable but request payer is set. What happens to PUTs for Anon? How do you do a PUT?

- if they have root creds
	- create a bucket that no IAM user can delete where they must delete the bucket policy with their root account

- broken replication scenario

HARD

Why is my event function not working? - URI encode the prefix filter special characters

----------
Forcibly clean up the buckets once finished - 
Create a self cleaning Lambda function that will delete all buckets tagged with the name of NHT-2018-S3
